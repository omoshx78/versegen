He will not leave you nor forsake you.", "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.", "But they that wait upon the Lord will renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles; they will run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.", "But Jesus looked at them and said, with men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.", "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.", "The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.", "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.", "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.", "He frustrates the plans of schemers so the work of their hands will not succeed", "But Moses said to the people, 'Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever'", "But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today.", "Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans", "May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed", "The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear?

If God is for us, who can be against us?", "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.", "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.", "For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known", "Because of the LORD’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.

Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.", "The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.", "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.", "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.", "Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice", "For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee", "Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me", "Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee", "This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.", "This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.", "He said, “If you listen carefully to the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you.”", "He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord"];
